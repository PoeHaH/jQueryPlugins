# searchtable.js

This plugin turns a plain HTML table into a searchable table. A search field will appear and
as you type, the HTML table is filtered to show the search results you are interested in.

# fader.js

Very simple fade-slideshow plugin for jQuery.
It does not contain prev/next buttons or slide numbers.

What it does contain is the ability to auto-update slide content:
If you populate the slides with ajax, this plug in will always pick
the newest slides (in other words: slides aren't cached and are refreshed each iteration)

This is especially handy if you want to use it as a TV narowcasting slider.
